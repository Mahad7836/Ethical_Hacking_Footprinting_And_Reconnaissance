Module 2, Footprinting & Reconnaissance, contains guides and resources for using tools like theHarvester, Sherlock, Photon, CeWL, and others to perform social media profiling, collect emails, subdomains, DNS data, and generate wordlists for the CY201 course at GIKI.

# Repository Structure

Guides for tools like theHarvester, Sherlock, Photon, CeWL, DNSRecon, and web-based services for OSINT and DNS enumeration.
Focused on social media profiling, email/subdomain collection, and website crawling for reconnaissance.

# Report
